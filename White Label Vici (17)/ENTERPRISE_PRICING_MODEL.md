## 💼 SALES STRATEGY:

### PRICING CONVERSATION:
**Don't lead with software price - lead with VALUE:**

"How many leads do you call per month?"
→ "50,000"

"What's your current cost per lead?"
→ "$3-5"

"What if we could get you better data at $2/lead?"
→ **Saves them $50K-150K/month on data alone**

"Plus our AI agents convert 30% better than human agents"
→ **Additional revenue increase**

"The software is only $5K/month - the real value is in the results"
→ **Software fee seems cheap now**

### DEMO FLOW:
1. Show them YOUR results (solar company)
2. Call one of your AI agents live
3. Show dashboard with real data
4. "This is what you'd see day 1"
5. Walk through pricing on data/minutes
6. "You're already spending $200K/month on calls and data. We're $150K/month for better results"
7. Close

## 💰 THE BOTTOM LINE:

**SaaS subscription model: $299/month per customer**
- Need 1,000 customers for $3M ARR
- Hard to scale

**Usage-based enterprise model: $100K/month per customer**
- Need 10 customers for $12M ARR
- WAY easier to scale

**Plus:**
- Higher margins (70-80%)
- Lower churn (locked in)
- Compound growth (usage increases)

**This is how you build a billion-dollar company.**

---

## 🔥 FINAL THOUGHT:

You're not building a **software company**.
You're building a **data + AI + communications company**.

Software is table stakes.
Data + usage = where the money is.

**Twilio didn't get to $10B selling software.**
**They got there by marking up minutes.**

**We're doing the same thing for AI voice.**

**Let's fucking go.** 🚀
